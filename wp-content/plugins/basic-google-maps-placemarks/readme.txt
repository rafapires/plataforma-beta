Embeds a Google Map into your site and lets you add map markers with custom icons and information windows.


== Description ==
BGMP creates a [custom post type](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types) for placemarks (markers) on a Google Map. The map is embedded into pages or posts using a shortcode, and there are settings to affect how it's displayed. Then you can create markers that will show up on the map using the featured image as the map icon. When a marker is clicked on, a box will appear showing its title and description.

**Features**

* Each map marker can have a unique custom icon, share a common custom icon, or use the default icon.
* Options to set the map type (street, satellite, etc), center location, size, zoom level, navigation controls, etc.
* Setup unique maps on different pages with their own placemarks, map types, center locations, etc.
* Placemarks can be assigned to categories, and you can control which categories are displayed on a individual map.
* Extra shortcode to output a text-based list of markers for mobile devices, search engines, etc.
* Lots of filters so that developers can customize and extend the plugin.
* Use HTML, images, etc inside the information window.
* Compatible with WordPress MultiSite.
* Internationalized (see [Other Notes](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/basic-google-maps-placemarks/other_notes/) for a current list of supported languages)

You can see a live example of the plugin running at [washingtonhousechurches.net](http://washingtonhousechurches.net).

Basic instructions are on [the Installation page](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/basic-google-maps-placemarks/installation/). Check [the FAQ](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/basic-google-maps-placemarks/faq/) and [support forums](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/basic-google-maps-placemarks) for help.

== Installation ==

**Automatic Installation**

1. Login to your blog and go to the Plugins page.
2. Click on the 'Add New' button.
3. Search for 'Basic Google Maps Placemarks'.
4. Click 'Install now'.
5. Enter your FTP or FTPS username and password. If you don't know it, you can ask your web host for it.
6. Click 'Activate plugin'.
8. Follow the Basic Usage instructions below

**Manual Installation**

1. Download the plugin and un-zip it.
2. Upload the *basic-google-maps-placemarks* folder to your *wp-content/plugins/* directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Follow the Basic Usage instructions below

**Manual Upgrading:**

1. Just re-upload the plugin folder to the wp-content/plugins directory to overwrite the old files.

**Basic Usage:**

1. After activating the plugin, go to the 'Basic Google Maps Placemarks' page under the Settings menu. Enter the address that the map should be centered on.
2. Create a page or post where you'd like to embed the map, and type `[bgmp-map]` in the content area.
3. Go to the Placemarks menu and click 'Add New'. Enter the title, address, etc.
4. Click on 'Set Featured Image' to upload the icon.
5. Click on the 'Publish' or 'Update' button to save the placemark.

**Advanced Usage:**

*Multiple maps with different locations, zoom levels, etc:*

1. Just add the extra parameters to the [bgmp-map] shortcode. Here's an example of the different ones you can use:

> [bgmp-map categories="parks,restaurants" width="500" height="500" center="chicago" zoom="10" type="terrain"]

*Multiple maps with different placemarks:*

1. Go to the Placemarks menu and click on Categories, and add a category for each set of placemarks.
2. Edit your placemarks and click on the category you want to assign them to.
3. Edit the place where the map is embedded and add the category parameter to the shortcode. For example: [bgmp-map categories="restaurants,record-stores"] or [bgmp-map categories="parks"]. Use the category's slug, which is displayed on the Categories page in step 1. Separate each slug with a comma.
4. You can add the [bgmp-map] shortcode to multiple pages, each time using a different set of categories.

*Setting the stacking order of overlapping markers:*

1. Choose which placemark you want to appear on top and edit it.
2. Enter a number in the Stacking Order meta box in the right column that is greater than the other placemark's stacking order.

*Adding a text-based list of placemarks to a page:*

1. Edit the post or page you want the list to appear on.
2. Type `[bgmp-list]` in the context area.
3. Click the 'Publish' or 'Update' button.
4. (optional) You can specifiy a specific category or categories to pull from. e.g., [bgmp-list categories="record-stores,parks"]

*Using [bgmp-map] in a template file with do_shortcode():*

For efficiency, the plugin only loads the required JavaScript, CSS and markup files on pages where it detects the map shortcode is being called. It's not practical to detect when [do_shortcode()](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/do_shortcode) is used in a template, so you need to manually let the plugin know to load the files by adding this code to your theme:

`
function bgmpShortcodeCalled()
{
	global $post;
	
	$shortcodePageSlugs = array(
		'first-page-slug',
		'second-page-slug',
		'hello-world'
	);
	
	if( $post )
		if( in_array( $post->post_name, $shortcodePageSlugs ) )
			add_filter( 'bgmp_map-shortcode-called', '__return_true' );
}
add_action( 'wp', 'bgmpShortcodeCalled' );
`

Copy and paste that into your theme's *functions.php* file or a [functionality plugin](http://www.doitwithwp.com/create-functions-plugin/), update the function names and filter arguments, and then add the slugs of any pages/posts containing the map to $shortcodePageSlugs. If you're using it on the home page, the slug will be 'home'.

This only works if the file that calls do_shortcode() is [registered as a page template](http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages#Creating_Your_Own_Page_Templates) and assigned to a page.

If you want to use any shortcode arguments, you'll have to put them inside a filter callback instead of the shortcode itself, e.g.,

`
function setBGMPMapShortcodeArguments( $options )
{
	global $bgmp;
	$coordinates = $bgmp->geocode( 'Seattle' );
	
	$options[ 'mapWidth' ]				= 500;
	$options[ 'mapHeight' ]				= 400;
	$options[ 'latitude' ]				= $coordinates[ 'latitude' ];
	$options[ 'longitude' ]				= $coordinates[ 'longitude' ];
	$options[ 'zoom' ]					= 10;
	$options[ 'type' ]					= 'ROADMAP';
	$options[ 'typeControl' ]			= 'HORIZONTAL_BAR';
	$options[ 'navigationControl' ]		= 'SMALL';
	$options[ 'infoWindowMaxWidth' ]	= 350;
	$options[ 'categories' ]			= array( 'record-stores', 'parks' );
	
	return $options;
}
add_filter( 'bgmp_map-shortcode-arguments', 'setBGMPMapShortcodeArguments' );
`

These are the valid arguments for map type, type control and navigation control. They're case-sensative.

*Map Type*

* ROADMAP
* SATELLITE
* HYBRID
* TERRAIN

*Map Type Control*

* off
* DEFAULT
* HORIZONTAL_BAR
* DROPDOWN_MENU

*Navigation Control*

* off
* DEFAULT
* SMALL
* ANDROID
* ZOOM_PAN

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use the plugin? =
Read the Basic Usage section of [the Installation page](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/basic-google-maps-placemarks/installation/) for instructions. If you still have questions, read this FAQ and check [the support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/basic-google-maps-placemarks).


= How can I get help when I'm having a problem? =

> **Don't e-mail me.** I automatically delete any support requests that come in over e-mail. Follow the steps below instead.

1. Read the [the Installation page](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/basic-google-maps-placemarks/installation/).
2. Read the answers in this FAQ.
3. Check [the support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/basic-google-maps-placemarks), because there's a good chance your problem has already been addressed there.
4. Check the [Other Notes](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/basic-google-maps-placemarks/other_notes/) page for known conflicts with other plugins.

If you still need help, then follow these instructions:

1. Disable all other plugins and switch to the default theme, then check if the problem is still happening. If it isn't, then the problem may actually be with your theme or other plugins you have installed.
3. If the problem is still happening, then start a new thread in the forum with a **detailed description** of your problem and **the URL to the page on your site where you placed the map**.
5. Check the 'Notify me of follow-up posts via e-mail' box so you won't miss any replies.

I monitor the forums and respond to a lot of the requests. I do this in my spare time, though, and can't respond to all of them. I typically only have time to help with problems that are within the plugin's scope. That means that I probably won't respond if the issue is actually caused by your theme or another plugin, or if you're trying to modify the plugin to do something it doesn't natively do. It's still a good idea to post something on the forums, though, because other users may be able to help out when I can't.


= Does the plugin support [non-standard feature]? / How can I get the plugin to do [non-standard feature]? =
All of the features that the plugin supports are documented on these pages. If you don't see a feature mentioned, then that means that the plugin doesn't support it. You'll need to write the extra code yourself if you want to add that feature to the plugin. There are filters throughout the core code to support customization. If you need a hook or filter that doesn't currently exist, add a post to [the support forums](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/basic-google-maps-placemarks) to request it and I'll add it to the next version.

You can also try searching [the support forums](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/basic-google-maps-placemarks) in case others have already worked out a way to do it.

If you do get it working with your custom code, please share it on [the support forums](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/basic-google-maps-placemarks) so that others can benefit from your work.


= The map doesn't look right. =
This is probably because some rules from your theme's stylesheet are being applied to the map. Contact your theme developer for advice on how to override the rules.


= The page says 'Loading map...', but the map never shows up. =
Check to see if there are any Javascript errors by [opening the JavaScript console](http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/q/8525/16266) in your web browser. An error caused by other plugins or your theme can prevent BGMP from working. You'll need to fix the errors, or switch to a different plugin/theme.

Also, make sure your theme is calling *[wp_footer()](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_footer)* right before the closing *body* tag in footer.php. 


= None of the placemarks are showing up on the map =
If your theme is calling `add_theme_support( 'post-thumbnails' )` and passing in a specific list of post types -- rather than enabling support for all post types -- then it should check if some post types are already registered and include those as well. This only applies if it's hooking into `after_theme_setup` with a priority higher than 10. Contact your theme developer and ask them to fix their code.

Also check the [Other Notes](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/basic-google-maps-placemarks/other_notes/) page for known conflicts with other plugins.

= Can I use coordinates to set the marker, instead of an address? =
Yes. You can type anything into the Address field that you would type into a standard Google Maps search field, which includes coordinates. 

If the plugin recognizes your input as coordinates then it will create the marker at that exact point on the map. If it doesn't, it will attempt to geocode them, which can sometimes result in a different location than you intended. To help the plugin recognize the coordinates, make sure they're in decimal notation (e.g. 48.61322,-123.3465) instead of minutes/seconds notation. The latitude and longitude must be separated by a comma and cannot contain any letters or symbols. If your input has been geocoded, you'll see a note next to the address field that gives the geocoded coordinates, and the plugin will use those to create the marker on the map; if you don't see that note then that means that your input was not geocoded and your exact coordates will be used to place the marker.

If you're having a hard time getting a set of coordinates to work, try visiting <a href="http://www.itouchmap.com/latlong.html" title="Latitude and Longitude of a Point">this page</a> and use the coordinates they give you.


= Can I change the default icon? =
Yes, if you want to use the same custom icon for all markers by default, instead of having to set it on each individual placemark, you can add this to your theme's functions.php or a [functionality plugin](http://www.doitwithwp.com/create-functions-plugin/):

`
function setBGMPDefaultIcon( $iconURL )
{
	return get_bloginfo( 'stylesheet_directory' ) . '/images/bgmp-default-icon.png';
}
add_filter( 'bgmp_default-icon', 'setBGMPDefaultIcon' );
`

The string you return needs to be the full URL to the new icon.

= How can I set the default icon by category or other condition? =
If you only want to replace the default marker under certain conditions (e.g., when the marker is assigned to a specific category), then you can using something like this:

`
function setBGMPDefaultIconByCategory( $iconURL, $placemarkID )
{
	$placemarkCategories = wp_get_object_terms( $placemarkID, 'bgmp-category' );

	foreach( $placemarkCategories as $pc )
		if( $pc->slug == 'restaurants' )
			$iconURL = get_bloginfo( 'stylesheet_directory' ) . '/images/bgmp-default-icon.png';

    return $iconURL;
}
add_filter( 'bgmp_default-icon', 'setBGMPDefaultIcon', 10, 2 );
`

Here's another example to uses the placemark's ID:

`
function setBGMPDefaultIconByID( $iconURL, $placemarkID )
{
	if( $placemarkID == 352 )
		$iconURL = get_bloginfo( 'stylesheet_directory' ) . '/images/bgmp-default-icon.png';
		
	return $iconURL;
}
add_filter( 'bgmp_default-icon', 'setBGMPDefaultIcon', 10, 2 );
`

The string you return needs to be the full URL to the new icon.


= Can I embed more than one map on the same page? =
No, the Google Maps JavaScript API can only support one map on a page. You can have different maps on separate pages, though. See [the Installation page](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/basic-google-maps-placemarks/installation/) for instructions on making different maps have different center locations, display different sets of placemarks, etc.


= How can I override the styles the plugin applies to the map? =
The width/height of the map and marker information windows are always defined in the Settings, but you can override everything else by putting this code in your theme's functions.php file or a [functionality plugin](http://www.doitwithwp.com/create-functions-plugin/):

`
function setBGMPStyle()
{
	wp_deregister_style( 'bgmp_style' );
	wp_register_style(
		'bgmp_style',
		get_bloginfo('template_url') . '/bgmp-style.css'
	);
	wp_enqueue_style( 'bgmp_style' );
}
add_action('init', 'setBGMPStyle');
`

Then create a bgmp-style.css file inside your theme directory or a [child theme](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes) and put your styles there. If you'd prefer, you could also just make it an empty file and put the styles in your main style.css, but either way you need to register and enqueue a style with the `bgmp_style` handle, because the plugin checks to make sure the CSS and JavaScript files are loaded before embedding the map.


= I get an error when using do_shortcode() to call the map shortcode =
See the instructions on [the Installation page](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/basic-google-maps-placemarks/installation/).


= How can I force the info. window width and height to always be the same size? =
Add the following styles to your theme's style.css file or a [child theme](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes):

`
.bgmp_placemark
{
	width: 450px;
	height: 350px;
}
`


= Can registered users create their own placemarks? =
Yes. The plugin creates a [custom post type](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types), so it has the same [permission structure](http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities) as regular posts/pages.


= I upgraded to the latest version and now the map isn't working. =
If you're running a caching plugin like WP Super Cache, make sure you delete the cache contents so that the latest files are loaded, and then refresh your browser.

If you upgraded other plugins at the same time, it's possible that one of them is causing a JavaScript error that breaks the entire page or some other kind of conflict. Check if the plugin works with the default theme and no other plugins activated.

= Are there any hooks I can use to modify or extend the plugin? =
Yes, I've tried to add filters for everything you might reasonably want, just browse the source code to look for them. If you need a filter or action that isn't there, make a request on [the support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/basic-google-maps-placemarks) and I'll add it to the next version.


== Other Notes ==

**Localizations**

* Chinese (thanks to [yzqiang](http://wordpress.org/support/profile/yzqiang))
* French (machine translated)

If there isn't a translation for your language (or it is incomplete/inaccurate) please consider making one and contributing it to the plugin. You can learn how by reading [Translating WordPress](http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress) and [How to Create a .po Language Translation](http://www.wdmac.com/how-to-create-a-po-language-translation). The .pot file you'll need is inside the *languages* directory in the plugin's folder. Once you're done, just [contact me](http://iandunn.name/contact) and send me the .po and .mo files, and I'll add them to the plugin.


**Known conflicts**

* The [Post Types Order](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/post-types-order/) plugin can cause <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-basic-google-maps-placemarks-shortcode-bgmp-list-not-returning-all-placemarks">the wrong placemarks to show up</a> in [bgmp-map] or [bgmp-list] results. Try disabling the *AutoSort* feature.
* The [Better WP Security](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/better-wp-security/) plugin may [break the Google Maps API](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-better-wp-security-google-maps-api) if the "Display random version number" option is enabled.
* The [bgmp-map] and [bgmp-list] shortcodes <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-basic-google-maps-placemarks-map-showing-all-placemarkers-no-filter">won't work in WP e-Commerce product post types</a>.
* Also make sure that no other Google Maps plugins are activated, and that your theme isn't including the Maps API. You can view the page's source code and search for instances of "maps.google.com/maps/api/js". If there's more than one, then you're probably going to have issues.

**How you can help with the plugin's development**

* The thing I could really use some help with is answering questions on [the support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/basic-google-maps-placemarks). I don't have a lot of time to work on the plugin, so the time I spend answering questions reduces the amount of time I have to add new features. If you're familiar with the plugin and would like to help out, you can click the 'Subscribe to Emails for this Plugin' link to get an e-mail whenever a new post is created.
* Translate the plugin into your language. See the *Localizations* section above for details.
* Volunteer to test new versions before they're officially released. [Contact me](http://iandunn.name/contact) if you want to be put on the list.
* If you find a bug, create a post on [the support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/basic-google-maps-placemarks) with as much information as possible. If you're a developer, create a patch and include a link to it in the post.
* Send me feedback on how easy or difficult the plugin is to use, and where you think things could be improved. Add a post to [the support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/basic-google-maps-placemarks) with details.   
* Review the code for security vulnerabilities and best practices. If you find a security issue, please [contact me](http://iandunn.name/contact) privately so that I can release a patched version before the issue is publicly disclosed.
* Check the TODO.txt file for features that need to be added and submit a patch.


**Donations**

I do this as a way to give back to the WordPress community, so I don't want to take any donations, but if you'd like to give something I'd encourage you to make a donation to [Doctors Without Borders](http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org).

**Customization**

If you need to hire a developer to add a feature that the plugin doesn't currently have, or to make extensive customizations in order to fit your specific needs, please [contact me](http://iandunn.name/contact) and we can discuss the details. I typically have projects booked at least 3 months in advance, so I'm not able to accomidate "urgent" requests. My minimum project size for this plugin is 10 hours worth of work.

If you just need some minor customizations or are looking for someone with a low hourly rate, I'd recommend checking out some of the [WordPress job-posting sites](http://wpmu.org/12-places-to-find-and-post-wordpress-jobs/). If you make customizations that could be benefitial to other users, please start a thread on [the support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/basic-google-maps-placemarks) with a description of them and a link to the source code.
